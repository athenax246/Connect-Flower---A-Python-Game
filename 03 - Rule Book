You and another player are gardiners! Gardiners take turns planting flowers in the flower bed.

There are two modes of the game: 
Two human players playing against each other 
One human player playing against the computer
The player can switch between the different modes of the game by changing the variable typegame.
Left Gardiner plants pink flowers, while Right Gardiner plants purple flowers.
In a game versus AI, you will be Left Gardiner
On your turn, drag and drop a flower above a column of the flower bed. The flower falls in the lowest unoccupied row of that column. 
When a column has seven flowers, it is full and can no longer be planted in.
The first gardiner to make a series of five connected flowers wins the game.
If the board is filled and neither player has five in a row, the game is tied.
The first player is randomly decided during each new game.
In a game versus AI, the computer will go first.
